How to design a programming language
====================================
This repo holds a single other markdown document for now in which I've listed some of the ingredients that I know are part of a programming language. I plan to flesh out the different parts into more detailed prose but for now they are mostly just bullet lists of things I thought of. I don't presume to know much about designing programming languages, but I do intend to find out. I hope to have time to update this repo with what I find out.
